**[autumn leaves](TODO)**

 * Nice UI experience for ImageMagick transformations
 * Runs 100% in the browser and offline. 
 * Easy to use tools for common tasks. 
 * Both a website and a framework around WASM-ImageMagick library
 * author, store, reuse, share transformations. 

# STATUS / ROADMAP

 * WIP
 * now researching IM and designing a friendly JS API for IM commands
 * (research) don't know how well wasm-IM will behave for complex tasks.
 * start by being just a im transformation editor by just editing im CLI text
 * try to compose (examples) real - life examples like http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick
 * then start designing and develop a nice UI to edit the commands more visually (no plain text)
